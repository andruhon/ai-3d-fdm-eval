I'll read the task file to understand what needs to be implemented.
Requested tools: read_file(path: scratchpad/task-02-tools.md)


📁 Reading file: scratchpad/task-02-tools.md

Let me read the OpenRouter tools documentation and the Bun test runner documentation to understand the requirements.
Requested tools: read_multiple_files(paths: ["scratchpad/openrouter-docs/09-api-tools.md","...)


📁 Reading 2 files

Now let me check the current project structure to understand what exists:
Requested tools: list_directory(path: .)


📁 Listing directory: .


Requested tools: read_file(path: index.ts)


📁 Reading file: index.ts

Now I understand the requirements. Let me implement the filesystem tools:

1. Create `src` directory
2. Implement `read_file` and `write_file` tools following the OpenRouter tool pattern
3. Create tests for these tools
4. Update `index.ts` to be minimal and import from src

Let's start:
Requested tools: create_directory(path: src)


📁 Creating directory: src

Now let me create the filesystem tools:
Requested tools: write_file(path: src/tools.ts, content: import { tool } from "@openrouter/sdk";
import ...)


📁 Writing file: src/tools.ts

Now let's create a minimal main entry point that uses these tools:
Requested tools: write_file(path: src/main.ts, content: import { OpenRouter } from "@openrouter/sdk";
i...)


📁 Writing file: src/main.ts

Now update the index.ts to be minimal:
Requested tools: write_file(path: index.ts, content: import { runExample } from "./src/main.js";

aw...)


📁 Writing file: index.ts

Now let's create the test file for the tools:
Requested tools: write_file(path: src/tools.test.ts, content: import { describe, test, expect, beforeEach, af...)


📁 Writing file: src/tools.test.ts

Now I need to request a command to run the tests. Let me do that:
Requested tools: request_tool(command: bun test, justification: We need to run the Bun test suite to verify tha...)


🔧 Executing request_tool: printf "%q\nCommand:" "$command" \n\n Justification:\n "$justification" bun test We need to run the Bun test suite to verify that the filesystem tools (read_file and write_file) are working correctly. This command will execute all test files matching the pattern *.test.ts and validate that our implementation meets the requirements.
Let me check if we already have a test command available by checking package.json:
Requested tools: read_file(path: package.json)
