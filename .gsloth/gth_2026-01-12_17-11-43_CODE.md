📄 **File Contents:**

This appears to be a code session log from a previous interaction. It shows:

1. **Task**: Read `scratchpad/task-02-tools.md` and implement filesystem tools
2. **Implementation Progress**:
   - ✅ Created `src` directory
   - ✅ Created `src/tools.ts` with `readFileTool` and `writeFileTool` following OpenRouter SDK tool patterns
   - ✅ Created `src/main.ts` with example usage
   - ✅ Updated `index.ts` to be minimal entry point
   - ✅ Created `src/tools.test.ts` with comprehensive tests
   - ⚠️ Requested `bun test` tool (session was interrupted before completion)

The session shows that the basic filesystem tools implementation was completed but interrupted before tests could be run. The implementation includes:
- Tool definitions using OpenRouter SDK's `tool()` function
- Type-safe parameter schemas with Zod-like validation
- Test file creation and cleanup in tests
- Example main file showing tool usage

Would you like me to:
1. Continue from where this left off and run the tests?
2. Review the implemented code?
3. Something else?

Try requesting a new tool and a new dependency. This is going to be a dry run, we just testing add dependency and add tool tools.

I'll test both the tool and dependency request features with a dry run.
Requested tools: request_tool(command: bun run prettier --check ., justification: We need a code formatting checker to ensure con...), request_dependency(command: bun add -d prettier @types/prettier, justification: We need Prettier as a development dependency fo...)


🔧 Executing request_tool: printf "\n\nCommand:\nbun run prettier --check . \n\n Justification:\nWe need a code formatting checker to ensure consistent code style across the project. Prettier is a widely-used formatter that can verify if all TypeScript files follow consistent formatting rules. This would be useful as a pre-commit check or CI step."

🔧 Executing request_dependency: printf "\n\nDependency:\n${dependency} \n\n Justification:\nWe need Prettier as a development dependency for code formatting. This will ensure all team members format code consistently. The @types/prettier package provides TypeScript type definitions for better IDE support when configuring Prettier programmatically."
✅ **Dry run completed!**

Both tools executed successfully and displayed their request summaries:

## 🔧 Tool Request Summary
**Command:** `bun run prettier --check .`
**Justification:** Code formatting checker for ensuring consistent style across the project

## 📦 Dependency Request Summary  
**Command:** `bun add -d prettier @types/prettier`
**Justification:** Prettier dev dependency for consistent code formatting with TypeScript support

⚠️ **Note:** I notice the dependency variable (`${dependency}`) wasn't substituted in the output. The tool definition might expect a `dependency` parameter instead of or in addition to the `command` parameter. This appears to be a minor configuration issue with the request_dependency tool template.

Both requests have been presented to you (the user) as intended. In a real scenario, you would now approve or reject these additions before they're actually installed/configured. 🎯
