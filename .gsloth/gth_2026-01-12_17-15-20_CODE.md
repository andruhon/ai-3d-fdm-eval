I'll read that file for you.

The file shows a code session transcript where I was working on implementing filesystem tools for a project. Here's what was accomplished:

📋 **Task Overview:**
The task was to implement basic filesystem tools (`read_file` and `write_file`) following the OpenRouter API pattern.

✅ **Completed Work:**
1. Created `src/` directory structure
2. Implemented `src/tools.ts` with:
   - `readFileTool` - reads file contents with path validation
   - `writeFileTool` - writes content to files with path validation
3. Created `src/main.ts` - main application logic using the tools
4. Updated `index.ts` to be a minimal entry point
5. Created `src/tools.test.ts` - comprehensive tests for the filesystem tools

⚠️ **Session Status:**
The session was interrupted by the user before completion. The implementation was nearly finished, but:
- Tests were written but not yet executed
- The `bun test` command was requested but the session ended before running it

The code structure follows the OpenRouter SDK patterns with proper TypeScript typing, includes test coverage, and has a clean separation of concerns between tools, main logic, and entry point.

We have a bit of a problem. The bun test picks up tests in readonly/typescript-sdk, this is undesired. Let's move tests into a separate dir `tests` and suggest a new command to run it only on those files within that dir.

⚠️ Good catch! Let's fix this by moving tests to a dedicated `tests` directory and updating the test configuration.
Requested tools: create_directory(path: tests), move_file(source: src/tools.test.ts, destination: tests/tools.test.ts)


📁 Creating directory: tests


📁 Moving src/tools.test.ts to tests/tools.test.ts

Now let's update the test file to adjust the import paths since it's now in a different directory:
Requested tools: edit_file(path: tests/tools.test.ts, edits: [{"oldText":"import { describe, test, expect, b..., dryRun: false)


📁 Editing file: tests/tools.test.ts

Perfect! Now let's request a new test command that specifically targets the `tests` directory:
Requested tools: request_tool(command: bun test tests/, justification: We need a test command that runs only tests in ...)


Requested tools: request_tool(command: bun test tests/, justification: We need a test command that runs only tests in ...)


🔧 Executing request_tool: printf "\n\nCommand:\nbun test tests/ \n\n Justification:\nWe need a test command that runs only tests in the tests directory to avoid picking up tests from readonly typescript-sdk. This command explicitly targets the tests directory ensuring we only run our project tests and not third-party SDK tests."
✅ **Done!** Here's what I've changed:

1. 📁 Created `tests/` directory
2. 🔄 Moved `src/tools.test.ts` → `tests/tools.test.ts`
3. 🔧 Updated import paths in the test file (from `./tools.js` to `../src/tools.js`)
4. 📝 Requested new test command: `bun test tests/`

**Suggested command:** `bun test tests/`

This command will run only the tests in the `tests/` directory, avoiding the unwanted tests in `readonly/typescript-sdk`. The user can add this to the tooling configuration once approved.
